# MovieRecommendationSystem-With-UserInterface
This is an Algozenith Hackathon project.
Required Libraries:  Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
Required Technologies : Jupyter Notebook, Tkinter, Python

Problem Statement:

Task 1: To make a movie recommender system using a different machine-learning algorithm using the given dataset.  We expect the following types of recommender systems:
1) Basic recommender system
2) Content-based recommender system

Task 2: Create an interactive application for the recommender system preferably using the python Tkinter library or any other with which you are comfortable. In this part, you have to use the Task 1 algorithms and then integrate them with the interface.
