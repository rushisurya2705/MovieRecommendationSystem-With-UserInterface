# Movie Recommendation System with GUI

This is an Algozenith Hackathon project.



## Problem Statement

1. To make a movie recommender system using a different machine-learning algorithm using the given dataset. We expect the following types of recommender systems:
- Basic recommender system
- Content-based recommender system

2. Create an interactive application for the recommender system preferably using the python Tkinter library or any other with which you are comfortable. In this part, you have to use the Task 1 algorithms and then integrate them with the interface.
